“Thanks for taking part today.

Before we begin, I’ll give you a quick rundown of the requirements for the camera-only chess tool we’re discussing.

A physical chessboard on a table.
A single camera—for example, your phone or a webcam—mounted or held above the board.
A computer or smartphone app that processes that camera feed in real time.

-- Any questions?

Physical setup details:
Mount or hold your camera approximately over the center of the board—doesn’t have to be perfectly 90° overhead. Our image-processing algorithms correct for slight angles and skew.
Open the app on your computer, point it at the board, and tap “Start.”
Enter an initial FEN if you’re picking up a custom position; otherwise, it assumes a standard start starting position and begins tracking moves automatically.

-- Any questions?

To Set up a game:

Select from 2 choices:
- Puzzle Solver
	- Randomly generates puzzles for you to solve.
	- This will require you to set up the starting physical position the same as specified by the program.
- Game Tracker
	- Set up a game from any position you like, and track moves automatically.
	- This will require you to provide a string FEN representation of the position you'd like to start with.
	- If starting from a default position, you will not be required to pass this.
- By Default
	- The game will assume you are starting a normal game from a starting position, therefore will require no manual input of any kind.

-- Any questions?

The features of the tool will be:
Puzzle Solving,
Move Feedback: Every time you make a move, it passes it to Stockfish in the background and shows you instantly if it’s a strong move, a mistake, or a blunder—just like an engine analysis on chess.com, but right on your OTB board.
Game History Saving: When you finish, it exports the full move list as a .PGN file so you can review or share your games later.
That’s it. You play your OTB game as normal, and behind the scenes you get engine feedback, puzzles, and a saved PGN—without ever moving pieces into a digital interface.
I’d love to hear your first impressions…”

-- interview questions start here
Intro (Player Chess background):
- Gathering information on chess background
	- how long you’ve been playing
	- your typical training routine
	- what you enjoy most about learning chess.
- Do you prefer playing chess digitally or in a traditional, Over the board manner?

Usability & Ease of Use:
- First Impression -> Based on the description, what’s your gut reaction? Does anything seem counter-intuitive or confusing?
- Setup -> Imagine you’re setting it up: pointing your phone’s camera at the board and tapping to start. What questions or concerns arise about how easy that would be

Trust in the tool:
- How confident would you feel that the program will see and understand your pieces and moves correctly? What would make you trust or doubt its accuracy?

Integration and adoption:
- If this camera-only tool slipped into your usual practice, such as game analysis or puzzle-solving, how well do you think it would fit into your already existing training method?
- What might hold you back from trying or sticking with a camera-only tool? (e.g., fear of mis-recognition, preference for screen-based interfaces, setup time)

Skill-Based Perspectives
- For Beginner -> Which of these features: Puzzles from a physical board, instant feedback, Game History—do you think would help you most as you’re still learning basics?

- For Advanced -> Which features would you be skeptical about or push harder on (e.g. precision of puzzle selection, depth of hints) to meet the standards of your already existing training routine?

Design Feedback & Wrap-Up:
- If you could tweak one aspect—accuracy, UI simplicity, types of puzzles—what would you change to make this tool genuinely valuable? 
- Would you recommend this technology to your chess-club peers?
