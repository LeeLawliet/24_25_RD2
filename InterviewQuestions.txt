Intro (Player Chess background):
- Tell me a bit about your chess experience—how long you’ve been playing, your typical training routine, and what you enjoy most about learning.
- Do you prefer playing chess digitally or Over the board?

Tool Summary:
- Mention that the tool will allow the player to learn chess in a traditional, over the board manner, while also utilizing the advantages of chess engines when it comes to training with digital chess.
- Mention that the tool requires only a camera setup and a physical chess board.
- Mention that the tool will require the user to input an initial FEN position manually, and the rest is automatic.

Usability & Ease of Use:
- First Impression -> Based on the description, what’s your gut reaction? Does anything seem counter-intuitive or confusing?
- Setup -> Imagine you’re setting it up: pointing your phone’s camera at the board and tapping to start. What questions or concerns arise about how easy that would be

Trust in the tool:
- The moves you make will be shown to you by the tool, how confident would you feel that it ‘sees’ your pieces correctly? What would make you trust or doubt its accuracy?

Integration and adoption:
- If this camera-only tool slipped into your usual practice, such as post game analysis, how well do you think it would fit into your already existing training method?
- What might hold you back from trying or sticking with a camera-only tool? (e.g., fear of mis-recognition, preference for screen-based interfaces, setup time)

Skill-Based Perspectives
- For Beginner -> Which of these features—move hints, puzzles from your board, instant feedback—do you think would help you most as you’re still learning basics?

- For Advanced -> Which features would you be skeptical about or push harder on (e.g. precision of puzzle selection, depth of hints) to meet your standards?

VII. Design Feedback & Wrap-Up:
- If you could tweak one aspect—accuracy, UI simplicity, types of puzzles—what would you change to make this tool genuinely valuable? Would you recommend it to your chess-club peers?
